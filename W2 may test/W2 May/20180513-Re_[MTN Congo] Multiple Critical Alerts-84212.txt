Dear Team,

 

AS per MTN, they were faced power issue at our  BZV Datacenter and some servers went down (EVD  nodes as well). Now the issue has been fixed and we need your support to check if you can access et check the component status.



But still few server are yet to  restore. We are coordinating with MTN to get this resolved.
