Subject: Re: Failed backup for mtnci-edb01c server : unreachable

 

Hi NOC,

 

We have informed already MTN to discard that host from their backup setup.

Kindly be informed that Active Active operation is ongoing @ MTNCI. Hence, we have made some modifications based on that.

 

 

Keep you posted.

 

 

Thanks.
