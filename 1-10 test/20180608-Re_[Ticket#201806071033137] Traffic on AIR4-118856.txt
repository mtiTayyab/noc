Dears,
 
Please be informed that there is a coming operation tomorrow on Friday morning at 04:00 AM from our Network WAN team for about one hour and 30 min.
So maybe we face disconnection with AIR4  but AIR3 should handle the traffic if we face any traffic interruption.
We will inform you once they finish to confirm that everything is normal.
 
Thank you ..
 
Kind Regards,
