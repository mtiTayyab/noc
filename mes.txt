Hi Essien,

The vpn tunnel is up now. I am able to access Benin server from Jumpgate. Please check now.

[root@jump01 ~]# ssh emanjapeth@10.77.73.200
The authenticity of host '10.77.73.200 (<no hostip for proxy command>)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is f2:d8:c3:2e:1d:a7:e3:66:4d:10:0b:d9:ec:8e:b2:0a.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
