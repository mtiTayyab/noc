Objet : Unable to Access WEB01B

 

Hi Adolph,

 

We are unable to access WEB01B  from  our office as well from Congo server. Please note WEB01B is hosting Nagios monitoring server of whole MTN-Congo ERS system including ERS/WEB/DB...etc. As long as this server is down we wont be able to perform proactive monitoring of MTN-Congo ERS system!!

 

 

Take this on priority and do the necessary actions.
