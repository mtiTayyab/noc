Dear Arslan,

I have gone through the report and find it much better than before but still I have made few 
adjustments in all the graphs and slides other than the first two graphs (Per Site stats and Alerts).
Attach is the updated final document you may compare with yours. 

Kind Regards

    P.S

    I have kept into account the last suggestions sent by Hassan Anwar and endeavored alot not to repeat the mistakes. Hopefully improvements will be evident from the report leaving no room for furthur refinement. Even then if you find any, please feel free to discuss with me.
