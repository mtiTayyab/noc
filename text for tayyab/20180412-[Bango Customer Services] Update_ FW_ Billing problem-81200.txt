Hi

Billing application file system is corrupt after planned work and will take extended time to restore.

Impact to customers:

Customer impact description:
Customer will NOT be able to view their invoice.
Not able to make top-ups.
Top-up through internet bank flow: customer after paying the top-up, they will not get the top-up (But they will be able to pay).
There will be a delay on Mitt3 where it is showing the unbilled usage for customer, it will not be real time in sync.
On Mitt3 the section to display customer's Free Units will NOT be viewable.
Billing will not bar customers when it is down, for IDRCC breach, Cost control breach, FU exceed breach, and will not send out any other notifications to other systems.
TOM orders will get stuck in processing until the issue is resolved.

Start time: 00:33
Technical staff actions/status so far: Infrastructure are working on restoring the data structure and after which Revenue will bring up the billing application.

Next update no later than 10:00

Regards
