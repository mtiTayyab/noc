A new date for this planned work has finally been decided.

 

Between 2018-04-20 00:00 – 02:00 CET prepaid top-ups towards Telia Company Sweden will not be possible.

 

During this time span the access URL that Seamless is using for sending top-ups towards Telia will be completely down due to a planned migration job. 

 

 

Best regards

Thomas, EFS/VSI Technical Governance @ Telia Company

Hi,

Due to a late call from one of the users affected by the change, the entire planned migration is called off for tonight. 

 

The project team will tomorrow morning identify a new date for the migration which will be communicated as soon as possible.

 

 

 

Best regards

Thomas
