Hello,

We received host down alert for syedb01b at 03:57 AM. Upon investigation we found that the host machine prtd02 is not responding. We disabled the alerts and tried to access prtd02, but it was not responding so we rebooted the machine from ILO and then restored the services. Everything is working fine now. The VMs that were effected due to this were sytrs01b, syedb01b and syedb01e. Upon initial investigation we did not find anything which can be related to this issue. There was nothing abnormal on the host before it went unresponsive. We are investigating at our end and will update you. Meanwhile also check at your end if there was any abnormality like power or network issue.

Below are the graphs showing server state(showing no abnormality). Memory graph is showing less memory used at the end due to reboot.
