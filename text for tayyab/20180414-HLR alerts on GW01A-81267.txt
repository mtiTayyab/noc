Hi

 

Following two alerts are observed on SYGW01A server from HLR side where SYGW01B association is working fine during this time . After this we can see traffic is coming normal.

 

S7L:2018-04-14 04:59:25.372 I0000 SCCP Maintenance event : SCPEV_RTF_NET_FAIL

S7L:2018-04-14 04:59:26.385 I0000 SCCP Maintenance event : SCPEV_RTF_NET_FAIL

 

Can you assist to check that everything is working fine on HLR side and there is NO association alert related to ERS side in your NMS as well.
